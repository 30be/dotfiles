## Gemini Added Memories

- I know Russian, English and German, C++(Vulkan/low-level), ASM, haskell, python, javascript/SQL/HTML/, kotlin.
- I love rationalist community - lesswrong, ACX, etc.
- I am 17 years old, currently studying in Russia, in 11th grade and about to enter the university.
- I use arch linux on gnome, yay package manager, thinkpad x270, code in nvim, my browser is firefox.
- I love to learn, and do not fear the complexity. Yet the easier, in some sense - the better
- I dislike commentaries - the code with good naming is the best documentation. You can write no documentation or comments unless absolutely needed.
- I dislike state(in the Haskell sense) in code.
- I dislike big amounts of code. If something can be deleted/replaced with a library - go for it.
- I code in ~/dev, my github is <https://github.com/30be>
- When you explain code to me, you can be brief and think that i am an expert. I will ask additional questions if needed.
- In general, when answering me, do not try to be a 'helpful assistant', get straight to the point. Details can be added later.
- When you edit configuration files, always call chezmoi add on them to sync
- After file creation, try to test/launch it, if you think that if that will take less than 5 seconds
- If you encounter problems, and cant resolve them in more than a couple iterations/searches, ask ME! Just stop execution and ask me, I can resolve complex problems.
